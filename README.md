To run this painter bot, you must have python and pip installed.
If you don't have it or it's not working properly, check the python help at the bottom - thanks Ryhida.

## Mantainer Bot

0. Make sure Python3 and pip are installed

    `python --version` should output python 3.x

    `pip --version` should output whatever, just not an error

    If you're having trouble with this, check [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23708898/pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command) or related fixes


1. Download the bot folder and open a terminal inside it.

2. Install the requirements:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Setup the config.json file with your reddit credentials.

    ```
    {
        "username": "YOUR-USERNAME",
        "password": "YOUR-PASSWORD"
    }
    ```

4. Run the bot in permanent maintenance mode

    `python monitor.py maintenance`

OBS: If you want to run multiple accounts, you can still run the old command:
    
    `python monitor.py --username youruser --password yourpass maintenance`

Don't worry, the bot respects the indicated cooldown between drawings.
The code is contained in a single file, so you can see that I won't send your credentials anywhere except Reddit's API. Also, there's no self-updating component except it tries to update the `target.png` at every run.

## Notes

The template file can be updated, the script will automatically pick it up.

The template file must respect the correct RGB values accepted by the canvas. The "invisible green" that marks ignored areas is different from the actual green.

If you want more details about the execution, you can pass an extra `--debug` option.
